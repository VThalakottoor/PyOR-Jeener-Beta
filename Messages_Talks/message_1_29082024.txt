Hello Everyone,

PyOR is a versatile NMR simulator designed for beginners. I strongly recommend using it alongside your favorite NMR textbook for the best learning experience.

Please note that there may be errors, so use PyOR with caution. If you see any mistakes or want to share any suggestions write to me (vineethfrancis.physics@gmail.com).

Best,
Vineeth.
